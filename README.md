# Oxytocin - Medical Clinic Management App

An advanced mobile application built with Flutter, designed to digitize the healthcare sector in Damascus. This project provides an integrated technical solution that connects patients with doctors, simplifying the process of finding clinics, booking appointments, and managing medical records efficiently and securely.

## 🚀 Flutter Features & Architectural Patterns

*A detailed overview of the key features, design patterns, and technologies implemented in the Oxytocin app using Flutter.*


| Feature / Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **State Management (Bloc)** | Manages the app’s state efficiently, separating business logic from UI for better scalability and maintainability. |
| **Navigation (GoRoute)** | Handles routing and navigation between screens in a structured way, supporting deep linking and nested routes. |
| **Google Maps Integration** | Displays interactive maps, allows plotting routes, showing clinic locations, and improving the user experience. |
| **Secure Token Storage** | Uses **Secure Storage** to safely store authentication tokens and sensitive user data on the device. |
| **Clean Architecture** | Organizes the project into layers (presentation, domain, data) to make the code more maintainable, testable, and scalable. |
| **MVVM Pattern** | Implements the Model-View-ViewModel pattern for a clear separation of UI and business logic, enhancing code readability. |
| **API Integration** | Connects the Flutter app to backend REST APIs to fetch and update data like doctors, appointments, and medical records. |
| **Push Notifications (FCM)** | Sends real-time notifications for appointments, updates, and reminders directly to the user. |
| **Local Storage (Shared Preferences / SQLite)** | Stores user settings, cached data, or offline information locally on the device. |
| **Responsive UI / Adaptive Design** | Ensures the app works smoothly on different screen sizes and orientations. |
| **Form Validation** | Provides input validation and error handling for forms like booking appointments or creating patient records. |
| **Error Handling & Loading States** | Implements consistent error handling and loading indicators for a better user experience. |
